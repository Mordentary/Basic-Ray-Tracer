# Basic-Ray-Tracer
Welcome to Basic-Ray-Tracer, a implementation of a ray tracer with C++. This project is based on the Ray Tracing book series by <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Peter Shirley</a> and aims to provide a basic introduction to the concept of ray tracing and how it can be used to create realistic images.


The renderer has been modified to be multithreaded, and the output of the ray tracer is saved in the JPG image format
